## This is an earlier version of the App!
- It functions perfectly when listening to System DarkMode via a foreground service but
- WorkManager was intended to be used to schedule the wallpaper switching time and as an alternate method to make the App more efficient in terms of 
consuming system resources all the time via a Service!
- WorkManager APIs seems to not work properly on my device(poco m3-pixel experience plus/android-13)
- I'm looking to integrate AlarmManager in place of WorkManager and it'll be live soon with full functionality!
- feel free to give your feedback on the Repository discussion!
- The compile/signed apk file for current code is present in app/release directory!
